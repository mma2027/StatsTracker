# This file controls when the system sends alerts about players approaching
# career milestones. Edit this file to customize milestone thresholds and
# alert settings for your athletics program.
#
# IMPORTANT: Be careful with spacing/indentation - YAML is sensitive to it!

# =============================================================================
# MILESTONE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# This section defines what milestones to track for each sport.
#
# HOW TO EDIT:
# 1. Find the sport you want to configure below
# 2. Find the statistic (e.g., PTS for points, G for goals)
# 3. Add or modify the milestone numbers in the list
#
# NOTES:
# - Stat names must match EXACTLY what appears in NCAA stats (case-sensitive!)
# - Use quotes around stat names that have spaces (e.g., "Tot Reb")
# - List milestone numbers from smallest to largest
# - To add a new milestone, just add another line with "- NUMBER"
# - To remove a milestone, delete or comment out the line with "#"
#
# EXAMPLE:
#   PTS:  # Points statistic
#     - 500   # First milestone at 500 points
#     - 1000  # Second milestone at 1,000 points
#     - 1500  # Third milestone at 1,500 points
